# vim-poml: Poml support in Vim

Poml is a rudimentary document structure language. Together with Tetanus (a lightweight inline markup language) it's designed to be a little friendlier to writers than XML, yet at the same time far more flexible than Markdown with respect to metadata tagging and custom markup applications.

As of this writing there are exactly two (*very* niche) use cases for Poml. This Vim package supports both of them with basic syntax highlighting. There are no special indentation features (all Poml elements are unindented) and no integration with compiler-like tools (none exist).
